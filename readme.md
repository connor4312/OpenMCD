# OpenMCD

This is a project, creating a drop-in replacement for the Multicraft daemon.

This is undertaken solely as an educational experience. It's written by a guy who knows almost nothing about Java, and you'd be insane to use this in a production environment.

## Building

Ensure you have Gradle installed. To build OpenMCD, simply run `gradle`. A jar will be placed in `build/libs`. Execute that jar to run the daemon (config and appropriate folders are created automatically).
